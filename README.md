# VehicleValueFinder
 This is a tool to help you compare a spreadsheet with an API to find a vehicles estimated value. 
 
# HOW TO USE
 This program requires an intital xlsx file with a Vehicle VIN header followed by a list of vins. 
 It'll process these with the VinAudit API and then insert them next to their corresponding value 
 on the spreadsheet.

# PURPOSE
 I built this program so we could find our current customers approximate value of their vehicle.
